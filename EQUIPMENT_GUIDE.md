- **Ring flash** (Parr) = Satirical social documentary signature

### Technology Drove Innovation:
- **Kodachrome** (Eggleston, McCurry) = Color as art form
- **Dye-transfer printing** (Eggleston) = Ultimate color control
- **Lightboxes** (Jeff Wall) = Photography as illuminated art
- **Digital** (Gursky) = Massive scale and post-production
- **Instant cameras** (Goldin) = Diary immediacy

### Limitations Created Signatures:
- **Pushed Tri-X** (Moriyama, Gilden) = Grain as aesthetic
